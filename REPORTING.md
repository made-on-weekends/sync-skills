## 🔍 Quick Checklist Before Submitting

1. **Search Existing Issues**: Check the active and closed issues in the issue tracker to see if someone else has already reported the same problem.
2. **Update to Latest Version**: Verify that you are running the latest version of the project, as the issue may have already been resolved.
3. **Verify Configuration**: Make sure all environment variables, setups, and configuration settings are correct.
